# 2023

I found that the version of glmnet I had previously compiled on linux has subtle
differences in results from the versions that I had running on Mac. I addressed
this by checking results against R and glmnet downloaded from CRAN, on a linux
machine (and on ARM Mac). I found that the matlab/linux results only match
CRAN if I include '-fdefault-integer-8 -fdefault-real-8' in the .xml file, i.e.

mex ./compile/gfortran-linux-intel-2023.xml glmnetMex.F GLMnet.f

(not all tests are the same, see glmnet_test repo) to check)

# To recompile on linux:

mex glmnetMex.F GLMnet.f

# Re 64-bit linux: We (Alex Ivanov, Ben Willmore) found that the Stanford-
# compiled glmnetMex.mexa64 failed on some big datasets (with a segmentation
# fault). We found that we could fix this on Ubuntu 18.04 by recompiling.
# The current version of glmnetMex.mexa64 is the result of that compilation
# but does not work at all on older versions of Ubuntu. Recompiling on older
# Ubuntu (14.04 / 16.04) didn't fix the crash on those platforms.

# If you are using an older version of Ubuntu, move glmnetMex.mexa64.14.04 to
# glmnetMex.mexa64. But be aware that it will crash on certain datasets.
